# neon-johnston

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jcpst/neon-johnston.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jcpst/neon-johnston)

A nodejs wrapper for the rust library [johnston](https://github.com/jcpst/johnston)

## Not currently maintained

I originally built this as a wrapper for using the Johnston library in a ServiceWorker for an electron application. A refactor in the Johnston library has allowed me to start targeting Webassembly, and I no longer have a use for these bindings.
